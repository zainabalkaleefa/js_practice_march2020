# Challenges

Once again we have a selection of JavaScript challenges for you to work through.

1. If you have not completed last week's challenges or you have received comments from us on Github, please revisit last the Week's challenges to complete/revise them before moving on
2. Take a look over your _indentation_ for the last couple of weeks' work. Does everything look neat? If you right click inside your files and select **Format Document**, does VSCode make any adjustments? If so, add and commit these changes.
3. Work through the challenges in the `challenges/week3.js` file, adding and committing your work as you go.

NB Take a look at previous instructions for how to only run individual test files, and individual tests.
